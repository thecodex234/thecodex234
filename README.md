hey<br>
<br>
i exist<br>
<br>
I like mostly writing in Python, but I also like using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I use Hash and LUA sometimes. But I know very little in the two.
Most of my projects are written in CoLab, which if you don't know, is essentially Jupyter Notebook but for your drive.

You can ask me for a multitude of things, just ask me :)<br>
